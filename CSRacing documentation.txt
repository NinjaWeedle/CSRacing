Detailing the "Mr. Womp Womp Optimization method" used in the Demo for the car data in CSR Garage:

All entries should be converted to base-18 normally, with the following exceptions for entries 2, 12, 13, and 14:
"basically, just multiply the 2nd one by 10
and the 12th, 13th and 14th by 100 before converting those to base 18
that gets rid of the decimals and the decompressor will divide it out later"

The result should be something like this (the Sivic Si is used here): "0148048B061C3G5A7498B25A120A0B01->Str2

Not used in the final due to being slow but it does save 12 bytes after using it on at least 10 cars
