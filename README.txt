CALCULATOR STREET RACING V0.8

A drag racing game written by Oxiti8 in pure TI-BASIC for the TI-84 Plus.

Collect, Race and Upgrade 30 different cars, or create your very own car from the ground up. 
Compete in 5 event types- Climb the rankings in officially sanctioned Ladder races, assert your racing prowess against CSR's best racers in the challenging Crew Battle mode,
challenge a friend in the 2-player action of Link Battle mode, demonstrate true mastery of your car in Car Specific races, or just make some quick cash in Regulation races.
The game's shell compatible, too. Can you conquer the drag strip?

1. HOW TO INSTALL:

Send CSRACING.8xp and CSRGARAG.8xp to RAM. (Or send CSRACING.8xp to archive if using a shell like MirageOS or Doors CS7)


2. HOW TO PLAY:

Navigating the main menu is simple - press one of the top five buttons (Y=, WINDOW, ZOOM, TRACE, or GRAPH) to select an option.
 - Press GRAPH to select "RACE" and access the event list.
 - Press TRACE to select the "TUNE" option and enter the upgrade shop.
 - Press WINDOW or ZOOM to select the "CSR GARAGE" option and open CSR Garage. (Refer to section 4 for more details on CSR Garage)
 - Press Y= to select the "QUIT" option and quit the game.

Racing controls: 

Press 2ND to start your engine and begin the countdown to launch. To rev quickly, repeatedly press 2ND. To rev slowly, press ALPHA (Or any key that isn't 2ND or ON). 
 - Pay attention to the text at the bottom of the screen- it'll tell you if your RPM is above, below, or at the number needed for the fastest launch.

Once the race begins, Your car will begin accelerating automatically. Press the up arrow key to shift up, and the down arrow key to shift down.
 - Every car drives differently. The best time to shift, the number of gears, best launch RPM, and many other stats differ from car to car, and certain cars may not need to shift at all for shorter races.


3. GAME MODES

Upon selecting the "RACE" option in the main menu, you will be presented the event list that shows the different kinds of races you can enter.
Each mode has its own rules:
 
- Regulation: Any car with any upgrades can enter. After selecting this option, you'll be asked to enter a difficulty level, and after that, the track length.
The difficulty level is the MPH the opponent will travel at: Entering a difficulty of 10 will have the opponent drive at a constant 10 MPH, a difficulty of 35 equates to 35 MPH, and so on and so forth.
The higher the difficulty level, the better the rewards!
After entering the difficulty, you'll be asked to specify the length of the road. A length of 1 is the standard length, 2 is double length, 3 is triple length, and 4 is quadruple length. The tracklength does not affect the Cr. earned for winning, but does slightly increase the payment for losing.

- Ladder: Race your way through 25 increasingly challenging races! The Grand Prize is 5000 Cr. Beware though: If you lose a race, you'll be knocked down a spot on the ladder.

- Crew Battle: Take on the best drivers CSRacing has to offer. There are three crews to beat, with each crew having 3 members. Crews will only race you if you use a car from their respective tier, so you'll need to save up your Cr. to buy cars- but the rewards are worth it. (For more info, see section 6)

- Car Specific: A true test of car mastery. You'll need to own all 30 cars in this game to complete this mode. Beating these races drops the price of creating a custom car. 

- Link Battle: Go head-to-head with another CSRacing player!


4. CSR GARAGE

Upon starting CSR Garage, you have two options to choose from:
 - Change Car: Self explanatory. Selecting this option lets you swap your car with others you own.
 - Car Dealer: Buy cars here. 4 cars are available for purchase each day, with a total of 28 cars available for purchase. 
   - Once you purchase a car, you can get in it from the Change Car menu.


5. TIPS & TRICKS

 - Good launches will earn you an extra 5 Cr, and Perfect launches will net you 10 extra Cr.
 - The key to the best shifts is to shift up the same frame the max speed in the current gear is reached- nailing the timing will let you constantly accelerate.
 - Upgrades offer a noticeable performance boost, but buying faster cars is eventually necessary to stay competitive.
 - Regulation races are a great way to earn Cr. - Just make sure to keep the difficulty at a level you can handle.
 - There are (planned to be, the game is not done yet) 30 cars in total- can you collect them all?


6. THE THREE CREWS

In the Crew Battle mode, you'll have to race the three unique crew members of each crew in order to progress to the next tier. 
The third and final member of each crew is the crew leader- You'll have to beat Leaders three times to get them to concede.

- Tier 1 - The Flames
This crew is the first you'll face. They control the west side of town. Their cars may not be the fastest, but their knowledge of their rides makes them a force to be reckoned with.
  Tier 1 first opponent: Ito - Drives a Beetle '04. Ito bought his car new, and has carefully maintained it in the 
  Tier 1 second opponent: Steve O - Drives an Impala SS. He was the one who gave this crew its name. He loves doing burnouts, but as a result has spent hundreds of dollars on tires…
  Tier 1 leader: Winnace - Drives a Javelin-AMS. Winnace spent months restoring his Javelin before forming The Flames- His dedication has seemingly paid off, as no challenger has managed to defeat him in a race since. He's grown somewhat complacent as a result…


- Tier 2 - The Tuners
The leader of this crew, Kenido, runs a repair & tuning shop alongside his older brother Mayeo in the east side of town. Some of the modifications they put on their cars aren't exactly street legal.
This crew loves to modify their cars. To show off the speed of their cars, the members of this crew race on a road double the length that The Flames do. You'll need to learn to time multiple gear changes right in order to win.
  Tier 2 first opponent: Ker - Drives a CRX SIR. Ker works as a detective. He joined The Tuners as part of an undercover operation to bust the local street racing scene (unbeknownst to Kenido). After realizing that this street racing could be a great tourist attraction for the financially struggling city, Ker managed to get a fairly long section of road legally sanctioned off for drag racing on the weekends. His job keeps him busy a lot, but his skill as a driver has kept him in the crew.
  Tier 2 second opponent: Mayeo -
  Tier 2 leader: Kenido

- Tier 3 - Team Oxiti
This final crew seems to be short a member. What isn't short is the quadruple length, dedicated drag strip this crew races on- Speeds in excess of 100 MPH are inevitable!
  Tier 3 first opponent: Goomzo
  Tier 3 leader: Muncher

8. DEVELOPER'S NOTES & TECHNICALITIES:

 - This game was developed on a TI-84 Plus with a non-mathprint OS installed. Users with OS version 2.53MP or higher should enable CLASSIC mode for the best speed & compatibility.
 - While CSR Garage can only be accessed on a TI-84 Plus, the base game, CSRACING.8xp, will work on a TI-83 Plus as it does not use TI-OS time. Please note that TI-83+ users will only be able to use the Sivic Si as a result.
 - The cars in this game have the same gear ratios and top speeds of their real world counterparts (The names are a bit different here due to copyright, but I'm sure you can figure out what cars they represent via the Developer's Documentation in the extras folder.)
 - Races take a couple seconds to start due to how slow the Shade( command is at drawing.
 - If you get ERR: UNDEFINED after the title screen, it's likely because you deleted Str1. To fix this, launch CSRGARAG.8xp and switch to any car.
