1. HOW TO INSTALL:

Send CSRACING.8xp and CSRGARAG.8xp to RAM. (Or send CSRACING.8xp to archive if using a shell like MirageOS or Doors CS7)


2. HOW TO PLAY:

Navigating the main menu is simple - press one of the top five buttons (Y=, WINDOW, ZOOM, TRACE, or GRAPH) to select an option.
 - Press GRAPH to select "RACE" and access the event list.
 - Press TRACE to select the "TUNE" option and enter the upgrade shop.
 - Press WINDOW or ZOOM to select the "CSR GARAGE" option and, well, open CSR Garage. (Refer to section 4 for more details on CSR Garage)
 - Press Y= to select the "QUIT" option and quit the game.

Racing controls: Press 2ND to rev your engine. The car accelerates automatically. Press the up arrow key to shift up, and the down arrow key to shift down.
 - Every car drives differently. The best time to shift as well as the best launch RPM differ from car to car, and certain cars may not need to shift at all.


3. GAME MODES

Upon selecting the "RACE" option in the main menu, you will be presented the event list that shows the different kinds of races you can enter.
Each mode has its own rules:
 - Regulation: Any car with any upgrades can enter. After selecting this option, you'll be asked to enter a difficulty level. The higher the number you enter (recommended range is 10-40), the better the rewards.
 - Ladder: Race your way through 25 increasingly challenging races! The Grand Prize is 50,000 Cr. Beware though: If you lose a race, you'll be knocked down a spot on the ladder.
 - Crew Battle: 
 - Car Specific: A true test of car mastery. You'll need to own all 30 cars in this game to complete this mode. Beat all 30 challenges, and Custom cars will be FREE to create. 
 - Link Battle: Go head-to-head with another CSRacing player!


4. CSR GARAGE

Upon starting CSR Garage, you have two options to choose from:
 - Change Car: Self explanatory. Selecting this option lets you swap your car with others you own.
 - Car Dealer: Buy cars here. 4 cars are available for purchase each day, with a total of 28 cars available for purchase.
   - Once you purchase a car, you can get in it from the Change Car menu.


5. TIPS & TRICKS

 - Good launches will earn you an extra 5 Cr, and Perfect launches will net you 10 extra Cr.
 - Upgrades offer a noticeable performance boost, but buying faster cars is eventually necessary to stay competitive.
 - Regulation races are a great way to earn Cr. - Just make sure to keep the difficulty at a level you can handle.
 - There are (planned to be, the game is not done yet) 30 cars in total- can you collect them all?


6. DEVELOPER'S NOTES & TECHNICALITIES:

 - This game was developed on a TI-84 Plus with a non-mathprint OS installed. Users with OS version 2.53MP or higher should enable CLASSIC mode for the best speed & compatibility.
 - While CSR Garage can only be accessed on a TI-84 Plus, the base game, CSRACING.8xp, will work on a TI-83 Plus as it does not use TI-OS time. Please note that TI-83+ users will only be able to use the Sivic Si as a result.
 - The cars in this game have the same gear ratios and top speeds of their real world counterparts (The names are a bit different here due to copyright, but I'm sure you can figure out what cars they represent.)
